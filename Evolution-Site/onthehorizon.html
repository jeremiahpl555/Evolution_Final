    Next generation communication devices will not conglomerate around the heads of people as Newsweek humorously portrays above. Instead, they will disappear into the wall of our homes, into our furniture, and for those on the move, into our clothes. The prototypes of these new mobile communications technologies are known as wearable computers (Mann & Niedzviecki (2002Â» . They are a range of mobile, multipurpose devices with powerful computing and communication capabilities.</p>
<p class="p7part2"
<p>Ostling (2004) reports an advanced stage of development of the prototype of an exoskeleton 1 wearable robot that could give soldiers and rescue workers exceptional endurance and strength. When marketed, the exoskeleton will consist of a super-strong metal frame into which the wearer steps. A range of body sensors coordinates the joint movements of the wearer with the movements of the robot, computed by an on-board computer in the wearer's backpack and powered by a power source also housed in the backpack. The robot will enable its wearer to hike vast distances and to effortlessly lift heavy objects.</p>
<p class="p7part3"
<p>Vorenberg (2003) predicts that smart clothes will be on shop shelves soon. They will be items of clothing woven from smart thread, a polymer that feels like nylon fabric, but that conducts electricity like metal, and that can therefore replace traditional threads in fabric to give clothes computer-like qualities. The inventors of smart
    thread are exploring the possibility of using this material to manufacture wearable computing devices, wearable telecommunications devices, wearable medical and athletic devices, and wearable fashion accessories that change colour, either automatically, or on demand.</p>
<p class="p7part4"
<p>Clothing made with this material would be able to sense conditions around or inside the wearer. A smart thread shirt or blouse would have the capacity to monitor ambient temperature and to adjust and automatically regulate body heat to make its wearer more comfortable, or it would be able to diagnostically monitor the vital signs of an athlete, a child or a patient.</p>
<p class="p7part5"
<p>Telecommunications is seen as a major application of smart thread by 2010. All the components of a videophone will be woven into the fabric of the item of clothing. The fashion industry is looking at using Smart Thread to make clothes that constantly change colour, change colour based on the wearer's preference for the day, or that reflect her mood.</p>
<p class="p7part6"
<p>Within the next decade, we can expect to wear trendy clothes with more powerful computational abilities than our present desktop computers. Such clothes will allow instant audio and video communication with anyone anywhere at any time. They will adjust to regulate one's body temperature, and monitor vital signs like one's heart rate, (one's)
    blood pressure, (one's) blood sugar, or whatever else one wishes to have monitored. Smart clothes will alert you to take whatever medication is due to be taken at the time, and that will tell your physician more accurately what your symptoms are than you yourself will be able to do.</p>

    The eventual convergence of a number of presently emerging technologies will enable humans to engage in cyberkinetic telecommunication and communication between humans and companion robots. The technologies to which I am referring are: nanotechnology, quantum computing, neuro-informatics, and cybernetics.</p>
    <p class ="p8part2"
    <p>Nanotechnology is a new':and fast expanding form of technology that is used to build complex microscopic machinery on the molecular and atomic level. Fully functional, complex nano machines are so small that about a thousand of them next to one another can comfortably pass through the eye of a needle. Nanotechnology is already being employed in computing and is set to transform computing beyond recognition in the near future (Stix (1994, 2001), Collins & Avouris (2000), Lieber (2001), Whitesides & Love (2001), Whitesides (2001), Alivisatos (2001), Roukes (2001) and Drexler (2001)).</p>
    <p class ="p8part3"
    <p>Quantum Computing is an emerging new branch of informatics that utilises the principles of quantum mechanics that were formulated nearly a hundred years ago, and which forms the basis for modem
        physics, chemistry, mathematics and cosmology. Quantum mechanics is a theory that describes the behaviour and interactions of subatomic elementary particles and their energy states. According to quantum theory, energy radiates in discrete packets, known as quanta. Experiments based on quantum theory have demonstrated that matter simultaneously has two modes of existence-it simultaneously manifests itself as particles and as waves. This means that everything in the universe, including humans, is built up from particles that are located in space-time, but which at the same time exists as waves that are not subject to space-time constraints. Quantum theory further states that a particle can be entangled in space-time at two different locations, which means that it simultaneously exists in more than one place.</p>
    <p class ="p8part4"
    <p>Because of this dual state of existence quantum theory includes an uncertainty principle, which states that an observer can either measure the velocity of a moving particle or ascertain its whereabouts, but one cannot do both at the same time. According to the theory, quanta change their behaviour when observed, because observation involves properties of quanta that localise them in space-time.</p>
    <p class ="p8part5"
    <p>Quantum computing uses the properties of quanta to do powerful
        information processing at high speeds on increasingly smaller instruments. Present-day information processing is limited to binary data states because it uses only combinations of a (zero) and I (one) to encode data strings. Because of the wave properties of quanta, and entanglement, they can manifest themselves in two places at the same time. This enables the encoding of data in five quantum probabilistic data states which makes it possible to encode vast amounts of information extremely fast by means of very small processors. Quantum encoding allows for data processing speeds that are hundreds of times faster than binary processing. Experimental quantum encryption has
        succeeded to use entanglement to teleport messages between communication instruments at different locations. It is already possible to teleport quantum messages. Someday it should also be possible to teleport the messenger itself. Brooks (2004:33) says:</p>
    <p class ="p8part6"
    <p>... Experiments show that the size of an object is no barrier to quantum-like behaviour ... So, could you be turned quantum? It all comes down to information or the flow of it. This determines how you interact with the world, and
        whether you can, for example. be in two places at once. If you want to be quantum you have to isolate yourself from
        your surroundings by making sure there is no way that you leak information.
        </p>
    <p class ="p8part7"
    <p>Returning from what may someday become possible to what is likely in the near future, a combination of nanotechnology, quantum computing and cybernetics will within the second or third decade of
        the 21st century cause communication and computation instruments to entirely disappear into the human body, and will eventually become as commonplace as cell phone communication is today.</p>
    <p class ="p8part8"
    <p>Neuro-Informatics is an emerging field of informatics in which microscopic brain implants are performed that allow nano-computers to enhance sensory inputs that enable the blind to see, the deaf to hear and the paralyzed to move.</p>
    <p class ="p8part9"
    <p>Cybernetics is a branch of informatics that studies communication in organisms, organic processes, and in electronic systems. A new branch of cybernetics, nano-neuro-cybernetics, is studying how biological control systems in the human body could use nanotechnology at the cellular level to achieve direct human-machine communication.
        A new form of mathematics is being developed to translate communication between biological cells and nano-instruments in the form of body implants. The following are important facts regarding nanoneuro-cybernetics that form the basis of the discussion of cyberkinetics and neuromorphic microchips in the next section:</p>
    <p class ="p8part10"
    <p>â¢ Each cell in a person's body is a battery that generates its own electric field;</p>
    <p class ="p8part11"
    <p>â¢ Each body generates its own complex electric aural field by combining the fields of individual cells;</p>
    <p class ="p8part12"
    <p>â¢ The active cells during particular brain processes generate brain waves that form an intimate part of cognitive processes by helping activated groups of neurons to co-opt inactivated ones during the process of entrainment;</p>
    <p class ="p8part13"
    <p>â¢ By means of nano-neuro-cybernetic events neural signals are decoded and translated into electronic signals that enable people to regain abilities that have become dysfunctional and to will electronic devices through mind control to perform specific operations.
        The process of mentally controlling electronic devices to perform specific operations is known as cyberkinetics.</p>
    <p class ="p8part14"
    <p>â¢ Biological forms that are cybernetically enhanced are cyborgs and the process of enhancing their abilities, or of compensating for dysfunctional natural abilities, is called cyberkinetics.</p>
    <p class ="p8part15"
    <p>During cyberkinetics neurological implants are used to meld neural signal processing and some form of information communication technology. This enables recipients to bypass damaged areas of their
        central nervous system to restore hearing and sight, or to bypass the motor cortex by tapping straight into neurons in the parietal lobe of the brain in order to directly control bionic limbs through thought processes. Advances in cyberkinetics are set to help patients with spinal cord injuries, strokes, Lou Gehrig's disease or other neural ailments to communicate better, or even to operate lights and other devices through mind control (Pollack (2004) and Warner (2004)).</p>
    <p class ="p8part16"
    <p>A recent beneficiary of cybernetic telecommunication is the American quadriplegic, Matthew Nagle of Stoughton, Massachusetts, who can switch on and off appliances via an electrode array directly implanted into his parietal lobe, the brain lobe that integrates neural signals from different sensory pathways before sending them for executive action to the motor cortex. In Matthew Nagle's case spinal neck injury has left all four of his limbs paralysed. By decoding neural signals in the parietal lobe and redirecting them directly to a computer via a wireless brain implant it is possible for Matthew Nagle to cyber kinetically will certain actions that are then executed by his computer, or to will a bionic hand to open and close, or to grasp (Mishra (2004), Philipkoski (2005), and Unauthored News Report (2005)).</p>
    <p class ="p8part17"
    <p>Boahen (2005:57-63) reports advanced research in the design and application of neuromorphic microchips. According to Boahen, neuromorphic electronics use compact, efficient microchips that electronically emulate the brain's neuro-chemical signalling processes. A major application would be implantable silicon retinas to restore vision to human patients, and that could also form part of robotic eyes. Neuromorphic microchips also have applications in other electronic sensory systems such as audio and olfactory recognition for robots and other intelligent machines. Boahen (2005:63) concludes:</p>
    <p class ="p8part18"
    <p>Morphing neural development processes instead of simply
        morphing neural circuitry holds great promise for handling
        complexity in the nanoelectronic systems of the future.
        </p>
    <p class ="p8part19"
    <p>In summary, cyberkinetic nano-computers as wide as the breadth of a hair, are being designed that will be used for manipulating the spin orientation of electrons, utilizing probabilistic quantum spin states for data processing. Such quantum data processing will enable minute computers to process data hundreds of times faster than the binary processing of the processors that we are currently using in state-of-the art computers.</p>
