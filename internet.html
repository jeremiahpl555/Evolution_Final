According to The new media Consortium (2005) a profound shift is taking place in the way people communicate and express themselves. Fueled by media that increasingly are crafted for a global audience, pervasive access to goods and services from ever more distant locales, access to networks and communication services that span the planet, and generational ties between youth that transcend borders, a new concept of language - and what it means to be 
literate - is evolving.</P>
<p class="p4part2"<p> Unlike the traditional notions of language and literacy, which are primarily unimodal and textual, this new form of communication and self-expression occurs multimodally, incorporating visual and aural elements with textual elements, and an immediacy which itself is a dimension of the new language. Technology, which has done much to make the creation and dissemination of written communication a familiar everyday' occurrence for most people, plays an especially important role in these new forms as well.</p>

<p class="p4part3" <p> Today, robust electronic communication networks integrate facilities for e-Communication, e-Commerce, e-Entertainment, e- . Government, e-Health and e-Learning in information age cultures. These online facilities enable individuals to communicate with relatives on far-flung corners of the globe. They allow people to pay monthly accounts via online banking facilities, to buy and sell products worldwide, to play computer games against opponents at distant locations, to join virtual communities online, consisting of people with mutual interests, to watch downloaded movies, to access data on government department websites, or to obtain certificates and degrees by means of online self-paced learning. Ordinary people can do any or all of these at the time of their choice from any networked location in the world, including from wireless broadband networks that allow mobile communication from buses and trains.</p>

    Digital satellite TV, such as Skye TV in Britain and DStv in Sub-Saharan Africa has widened the range of channels and programmed types to which subscribers have access. DStv, for instance, gives subscribers access to a variety of entertainment and educational channels, over and above local public service broadcaster channels like TV 1-3 and e.

    Where an information technology is used that allows the content provider to control the time of delivery, one has an instance of push technology. Where an information technology is used that enables the subscriber to decide on the time of delivery, one has an instance of pull technology. A common characteristic of present digital TV channels is that they still use push technology that the viewer still has to wait for the time slot in which a program is transmitted before they can view it. In the case of international channels that transmit content in several cycles over a 24 hour period, viewers have the limited flexibility of deciding in which phase of the repeat cycle they want to view a particular programme. However, in the case of pre-recorded (nonlive) digital content it is already possible in principle to implement pull technology to enable subscribers to customize at what times of which days they want to download and watch particular programmes. With the increasing sophistication of digital content compression and delivery, and particularly as competition between digital content providers increases, it is only a matter of time before content will be delivered at the convenience of individual subscribers rather than at the convenience of service providers.

<h2>Already Among Us: 
    Small, Smart and Powerful Mobile Communication Devices <span class="Saira"></span></h2>

<p>With the introduction of sound and the graphical user interface (GUI) the desktop computer in the mid nineteen eighties allowed users to take the first steps to use electronic communication in the same way as nonverbal and verbal communication. Not only could text be formatted in any way that the user desired, s/he could embed full colour graphics and sound in documents. An emerging array of multifunctional communication devices allows people to employ humankind's primary form of communication, nonverbal and verbal communication in direct person to person communication.</p>
    

<p class="p6part2"<p>However, these are only the first baby steps in the mobile communication revolution that is about to unfold. The future of interpersonal communications increasingly will be powerful, mobile, multisensory and miniature. The past fifteen years has seen the emergence and convergence of a range of personal mobile communication instruments. It began with brick-sized voice-only mobile phones, soon followed by dual-purpose pocket size mobile phones that enabled voice and text messages. The present generation of low-end mobile phones are positively petite, with voice, text and photograph-and-send capabilities. Middle level phones are equipped with cameras, video, global positioning and Internet connectivity.</p>
<p class="p6part3"<p>According~ to Hand (2004) and Hall & Dumas (2004) a range of high-end multipurpose mobile communication and computation instruments are available that allow their owners to phone, surf the Internet, and send e-mail and other documents, to word-process document and create spreadsheets that can be wirelessly downloaded on personal computers. An example of this is the multipurpose BlackBerry mobile communicator with full phone and email capabilities:</p>
<p class="p6part4"<p>Mobile communications devices like the Pocket PC and other
    types of Smartphones can be used for basic word processing (by using a stylus on an on-screen keyboard), e-mail, web browsing, as a MP 3 music player, a photo album, as well as an e-library for books
    stored on stamp-size interchangeable 2 GB smartcards.</p> 
<p class="p6part5"<p>Such devices also allow the user or the receiver to identify the user's geographical location by means of global positioning satellite (OPS) technology, or to be navigated by voice prompts through the streets of
    the major cities in the USA. In addition, in the USA such mobile communications instruments are used by paramedics to upload the diagnostic vital signs of patients being transported to
    emergency medical facilities, and transmit them to the destination hospital so that emergency medical personnel can
    prepare for the treatment of the patient ahead of arrival.</p> 
<p class="p6part6"<p>According to Fairley (2004), a new generation of cheap, flexible solar cells could avert the world's impending energy crisis. The new solar cell technology, developed by Konarka Technologies, consists of nano-chemical surfaces printed onto flexible plastic sheets, indistinguishable from photographic film, that can be manufactured in any desired length and width, and that will deliver endless energy when exposed to sunlight. Such solar film cells will play a major role in delivering affordable energy to private homes, public institutions and mobile communication devices. They will also be utilised in smart books, lightweight bendable e-Reader tablets that can be uploaded with any amount of audio, video, graphics and text, depending on the memory capacity of the e-Reader. Electronic smart books, newspapers, magazines and journals are set to replace their paper-based counterparts. New editions of these "print" media will be downloaded directly from publishers to the e-Readers of subscribers by means of wireless wideband networks.</p> 
<p class="p6part7"<p>According to Tambini (2002), we have recently seen the appearance of the virtual consultant in wireless networked communities. In situations where virtual consultancy operates, a guide with a lightweight mobile television camera mounted on the shoulders and the side of the head, enters a scene that warrants inspection and analysis. At the other end, an expert analyses the situation and decides what has to be done to solve the particular crisis at hand.</p> 
<p class="p6part8"<p>A recent addition to the range of mobile communication devices is a lightweight, pocket size personal digital assistant (PDA) with an optional extendable screen that offers telephony, global positioning satellite (GPS) tracking, access to the Internet and a virtual keyboard that uses hand movement scanning sensors to calculate which symbols
    on the virtual keyboard the user is pressing. The October/ November 2004 issue of the e-magazine Pocket PC advertises the WorldNavigator GPS travel companion that offers worldwide maps for road and marine travel, and aviation.</p> 
<p class="p6part9"<p>Already available in Japan is a range of multipurpose G3 full video communication devices that await the improvement of wireless bandwidth in the West to deliver high quality video telephony. These devices are bound to signal the demise of teleconferencing just as the present use of cell phone SMS messaging has all but stopped the use of telegrams.</p>
