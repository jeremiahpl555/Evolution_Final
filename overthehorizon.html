<p class="p9"
<p>Non-humanoid robots have been used for a number of decades in assembly settings to due repetitive precision tasks that tax human concentration beyond its limits. They basically are just expensive precision computational instruments that perform tasks in sequences that human designers have predetermined and pre-programmed. There are also a number of entertainment robots, like Honda's Asimo, that are mainly being used for promotional purposes. Asimo has no sensations about its environment and walks and talks by remote control.</p>
<p class="p9part2"
<p>In order for a robot to be intelligent, it must be aware of its environment. This cannot be done by serial information processing, the principle on which 99% of present computers on planet earth work. What is needed is a system of parallel distributed processing (PDP), also known as neural network processing, that allows the computer to become aware of its environment and to program itself by learning from its environment, just as humans do. In PDP computers, there is no distinction between hardware and software. As the computer learns about its environment, it adjusts its neural network settings, just as the human brain does. In both PDP computers and humans the continuous reconfiguration of synaptic settings, reprograms the neural network with up to date information about its environment. The present generation of PDP computers is said to have a level of intelligence comparable with insects.Â </p>
<p class="p9part3"
<p>Some robotics engineers are making optimistic predictions that bipedal humanoid companion robots, in the form of servants, assistants and companions, could be available within the next 20 years.</p>
<p class="p9part4"
<p>At the lower end of robotic sophistication one would have a bipedal anthropoid worker like Asimo that can be pre-programmed with scripts for butler like social interactions, or with housemaid like scripts to do the laundry and wash up, and that can engage in general conversations about every-day matters. At the upper end we would be talking about self-aware, sentient beings where parallel distributive processing AI, using nano scale neuromorphic microchip technology, described by Boahen (2005), would generate an open ended, extendable knowledge base that would enable the robot to learn from, and adjust to new experiences.</p>

<p class="p10"
<p>A discussion of this nature would be incomplete without an inquiry about ethical and moral issues that at this stage may be considered to be at the periphery of informatics by some information scientists. I personally believe that all species extract particular narrow sensations of the environment in the form of extremely complex species specific mental models (memories and reasoning processes) that optimise their chances of survival in the particular niches that they occupy in nature. Different species have configurations of sensory abilities that are specialised for their own survival because the mental model of each species would constitute a partial drastically oversimplified abstraction of ultimate reality.</p>
<p class="p10part2"
<p>Memories of our past experiences give us self-identity. If my assessment is correct, we will be able to create intelligent companion robots that are sentient, not only at the limited ranges that inform human cognition, but at ranges where we are unaware and agnostic, e.g. at the X-ray range, the ultraviolet range, the infrared range and the extra low frequency range. Using the principles of kirlian vision (revealing the auras that all life forms radiate in electromagnetic fields), caregiver robots would for instance be able to sense and diagnose maladies for which we now use separate diagnostic instruments.</p>
<p class="p10part3"
<p>It is well-known that loneliness drives people to accept radio and TV as surrogate human companions. There is no reason why humans will not also accept companion robots. It would be relatively easy to
    program a robot to engage in polite small talk and to signal polite submissiveness. However, to be socially acceptable and to engage in credible nuanced meaningful communications robots would have to
    limit their conversations with humans to sensations with which humans are familiar. They would have to be good at reading nonverbal communication cues (facial expression, gestures, tone of voice, body movement and body stance), and would have to project human emotions by means of their own body language, besides having an extensive, nuanced language based communication capability.
    </p>
<p class="p10part4"
<p>Particular emotions govern all forms of human behaviour. How will we enable robots to understand human behaviour and interpret human communication in view of the fact that learning and memory require the co-indexing of the facts of events and the emotions that we experienced during those events?</p>
<p class="p10part5"
<p>In the preceding article, The Evolution of Human Communication from Nonverbal Communication to Electronic Communications, I indicated that human behaviour ranges along a survival continuum: cooperation>competition> confrontation. Humans have to excel in all three types of behaviour in order to survive. Will we limit/inhibit robots to only cooperative forms of behaviour, a la Asimov's famous three laws of robotics? The de facto involvement of military establishments in research and funding of AI research make this a utopian objective. We can assume that robotic activities will range from the gentle caring of the vulnerable to the ruthless elimination of enemies.</p>
<p class="p10part6"
<p>As I stated before, humans are not brains in nutrient rich vats, but beings that experience as well as remember with our whole bodies, our central nervous systems as well as our peripheral nervous systems. For
    instance, when you encounter someone with whom you have had a run in before, that hollow feeling on the pit of your stomach is part of the memories of the past encounter that have been re-awoken. Robots would have to experience emotions before they could understand human behaviour and interpret human communications. Humans distinguish between what is logically true and false, and between what is morally right and wrong. How will we enable our robots to make both sets of distinctions?</p>
<p class="p10part7"
<p>A surprising amount of human cognition and communication is metaphoric (Lakoff and Johnson (1980, 1999), Fauconnier and Turner (2002), Klopper (2002,2003)). The hallmark of metaphoric thinking is
    that entities that are not literally similar are being equated figuratively in order to focus on unexpected similarities between them. For instance, depending on the nature of a competitive behaviour, opponents
    could be portrayed as chess players, tennis players, boxers, wrestlers or duellists. In the domain of sexual desire a desiring male can be portrayed as an old goat and a desirable female as tender leaves. Because
    metaphor formation is spontaneous and creative we are dealing with an open ended process of meaning creation. Therefore, the ultimate challenge would be to get robots to understand the almost infinite variety of figurative meanings that humans could evoke with such metaphors, let alone the emotive mind-body states that metaphors evoke in fellow Communicators.</p>
