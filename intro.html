    In the first article of this two part contribution, The evolution of human communication, I showed how past forms of communication have emerged periodically to help humans cope with increasing cultural complexification. In the second article, Future Communications I extrapolate from present-day emerging and converging forms of electronic communication to predict how different forms of human communication are set to change in the immediate future, the intermediate and in the more distant future. Two theses inform the conclusions that I present in the two interrelated articles:
</p>
   <p class="p1point1"
   <p>1. The emergence of electronic forms of communication must be analyzed and
    understood in relation to the past emergence of other forms of human communication; 
    </p>  
    <p class="p1point2"
    <p>     2. The rapid pace at which forms of electronic communication are presently
        emerging, maturing and converging is determined by psychodynamic and sociodynamic forces that are as old as humankind itself.</p>
    
</p>

<p class="p2"
<p>

    The four major conclusions that I come to when the two interrelated articles, The Evolution of Human Communication from Nonverbal Communication to Electronic Communications and Future Communications: Mobile Communications,
Cybernetics, Neuro-Informatics and Beyond are read together, are: </p>

<p class="p2point1"
<p> I. The psyches and metabolisms of modem humans were forged over aeons of hunter-gatherer nomadic existence. Our ancient nomadic souls are incongruent with present-day sedentary existence. However, it is the same hunter gatherer nomadic soul that has embraced the conceptual metaphor cluster, to communicate electronically is to move about, explore, travel and visit people at new destinations, revealing a nomadic belief system as old as humankind itself that also underpins all of our Internet-related and mobile communications. </p>

<p class="p2point2" 
<p>2. In the short and medium terms, electronic communication instruments are disappearing from our desktops into the walls of our buildings and into our furniture, into vehicles of transport and clothing. In the more distant future electronic communication will diversify and disappear into our nomadic bodies electric. </p>
<p class="p2point3"
<p>3. Human bionics I will emerge as one of the major applications of informatics in the 21'1 century, first in the form of biomedical informatics, but later on in the form of biosensory enhancement for pleasure in the virtual reality leisure time industry which is beginning to emerge at present. </p>
<p class="p2point4"
<p>
4. In the longer term, human communication will be extended to encompass credible communication with sentient, self-aware forms of artificial intelligence (AI) of which some forms will be identifiable as android companion robots, while other forms of AI will be diffused throughout the complex layers of informatics that will regulate the global knowledge culture that has begun taking shape since the nineteen sixties.

    In 1969, the year that the first human set foot on the moon, I was asked to address fellow students at a convention that had as theme the impact that technology was expected to have on the future of humankind. After I consulted the works of a number of futurologists, I spoke on the likelihood that the rampant use of technology would cause catastrophic worldwide pollution. I also spoke about future scenarios for space exploration, and about the tremendous impact that astronomy was expected to have on humankind's understanding of our place in the universe. I concluded my speech by talking about the role that future satellite communication was expected to play in the development of global mass communications. The one topic that I did not talk about, because not even the experts had foreseen its emergence a decade later, was the personal computer, and the tremendous role that it would play in the globalization of human culture, knowledge dissemination and independent learning, once linked to a global information network that was to become known as the Internet. </p>
    <p class="p3"
    <p> The reason why I totally failed to anticipate the rise of global electronic communication, which was set to redefine how humans would live, work, learn and play in the 21 st Century, is because I failed to understand that the human psyche was forged over a period of a hundred thousand years when our ancestors wandered across the globe on foot, following their major food resources, game, and foraging as they went along. The soul of present-day humanity essentially remains the same as the nomadic soul of our hunter-gatherer ancestors. The powerful grip of nomadism on the modem mind can be seen in the fact that learning is conceptualized by means of a cluster of movement metaphors. For instance, one explores alternatives, one comes to conclusions, one goes to look for solutions, one arrives at new conclusions, etc. My contention is that humans were driven to develop a facility like the Internet because it gives expression to our beliefs that learning is a journey of exploration. The Internet enables us to believe that we are surfing and going places, while in fact we remain stationary.</p>

    <p>When I first used the fledgling South African branch of the Internet in the late nineteen eighties, I had to place a long distance telephone call from Durban to the CSIR in Pretoria. Once connected to a search agency in the USA via satellite, I furtively delivered a pre prepared search query. Twelve hours later, I had to dial in again to the CSIR in Pretoria to download the plain text results of my query. Today we have access to a vast array of services from all over the world at local telephone call rates. For those who can afford the vastly overpriced rates charged for DSL connectivity provided by Telkom, or the marginally better priced rates charged by the satellite signal distribution company, Sentech, year-round twenty-four-hour, wide band connectivity has now become available in certain metropolitan centres in South Africa. The sad fact is that telecommunications is about twenty times too expensive in South Africa in comparison with enriched societies like the USA, Britain, Europe, Canada, Australia, Singapore and Japan.</p>

<p class="p3part3"
    <p>By using one of dozens of search engines or clustering/ meta search engines (which simultaneously query multiple search engines), one can have at your disposal in seconds documents in full colour with sound and video files embedded, available day and night on more than five million servers worldwide. Worth noting is Google's Scholar search engine at www.scholar.google.com. which filters out about 95% of the irrelevant websites, allowing proper scholarly search queries. Other Google services that provide superior search facilities are Google Suggest and Google Earth.</p>

<p class="p3part4"
    <p>The 20th century saw the rise of informatics as free-market, open societies increasingly began depending on the Internet to form part of an integrated global knowledge-driven free market economy, regulated by the flow of data between economies, including the flow of electronic capital that is not substantiated by bullion or hard currency. Globally disseminated knowledge flows enable national economies and cultures to rapidly adjust to trends of increasingly rapid change in order to maintain a competitive edge over economies that remain trapped in pastoral and industrial cultures. By the most recent estimate, there are now 6.5 billion humans on the planet. We have settled every landmass on the planet with the exception of Antarctica. Equipped with the proper communication devices, any two humans who wish can now instantly communicate with one another regardless of where they are. This is a remarkable achievement, considering that until very recently we could only communicate with people in our immediate vicinity.</p>
