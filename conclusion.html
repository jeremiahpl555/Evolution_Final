    In my characterization of the evolution of human communication and my predictions about he future of human communications I respectively showed that in order to discern future trends we first have look back at how human nonverbal and small-group verbal communication evolved over the past 100,000 years, during humankind's
hunter-gather nomadic phase of existence, because the soul of modem humans was formed over aeons by our ancestors' struggles for survival against the elements, against predators and against other hominids.</p>
<p class="p11part2"
<p>I showed how in the course of the past 10,000 years new forms of communication periodically emerged in response to greater cultural complexification. I also showed how over the past 100 years electronic communications emerged as a present-day expression of our survival imperative. I showed how in the immediate future mobile communication and computation instruments are set to disappear into our buildings, furniture and clothes because the human soul that evolved over the past 100,000 years is the soul of a nomad. This is evidenced by the
    fact that humans worldwide use a range of travel metaphors (going online, surfing the web, visiting a website, entering or exiting a database, etc) that together form a generic conceptual metaphor "experiencing something new is moving somewhere."</p>
<p class="p11part3"
<p>I showed how the confluence of quantum computing, nanotechnology and cybernetics is leading to the emergence of the new science, neuro-nano-informatics that will cause electronic communication and computing devices to disappear into our bodies-electric. This will initially happen to solve medical problems like quadriplegia, deafness and blindness, but will give rise to cyborgs (neuro-technically enhanced humans) as a social phenomenon towards the last quarter of the 21 st century. Round about the same time, or perhaps early in the 22nd century, an advanced form ofnano-infonnatics is predicted to give rise to androids (humanoid robots) in the form of a variety of companion robots. The rise of cyborgs and androids as social phenomena will be motivated by the progressive ageing in affluent human populations in the northern hemisphere, and in response to the collapse of the core family during the 20th century as humankind's primary environment for nurturing and socialising children. The collapse of the core family has already set in motion the reconfiguration of social groups, real and virtual, in western societies. The availability of companion androids as caregivers to the young, the infirm and the lonely will be a natural extension of this process of social reconfiguration that has already begun.</p>
<p class="p11part4"
<p>Finally, in spite of unmanned probes to nearby planets at present, the nomadic soul of humans will lead to manned space exploration and interplanetary settlement, complemented by android labour. In my estimation, human-android space exploration will be a defining feature of the 22nd century.</p>
